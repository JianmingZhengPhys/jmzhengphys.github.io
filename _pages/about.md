Hi! I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interest lies in quantum chaos in gravitational systems. Currently my research focuses on the relation between the late time behavior of black holes and random matrix theories, and how to use traversable wormhole to understand many-body quantum teleportation. I'm also interested in more formal aspects of gauge-gravity dualities, like how to formulate a string theory description for QCD and matrix models.  
  
I've been doing research in the [Institute for Advanced Studies](https://www.ias.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. I'm very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Zhenbin Yang. In the summer of 2024 I'll be a visiting scholar at University of California, Davis, hosted by [Prof. Mukund Rangamani](https://mukund.physics.ucdavis.edu/).  
  
You can find my CV here: [My curriculum vitae](assets/CV.pdf).  
  
I'm really keen on musicals, anime, and also all kinds of games. I'm currently trying to conquer Monster Hunter Rise. Besides, I occasionally play tennis.
