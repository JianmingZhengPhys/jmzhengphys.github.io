Hi! I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interest lies in quantum gravity and quantum chaos. Currently my research focuses on random matrices and wormholes, especially on how they help us to understand many-body quantum teleportation and the late time behavior of black holes. I'm also interested in more formal aspects of gauge-gravity duality, like how to formulate a string theory description for QCD and matrix models.  
  
I've been doing research in the [Institute for Advanced Studies](https://www.ias.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. I'm very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Zhenbin Yang. From July 2024 I'll be visiting University of California, Davis for summer internship, hosted by [Prof. Mukund Rangamani](https://mukund.physics.ucdavis.edu/).  
  
You can find my CV here: [My curriculum vitae](assets/CV.pdf).  
  
I'm really keen on musicals, anime, and also all kinds of games. I'm currently trying to conquer Monster Hunter Rise. Besides, I occasionally play tennis.
