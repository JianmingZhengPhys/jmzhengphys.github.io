This is an unfinished note on Liouville field theory and non-critical string theory. We discuss 2D quantum gravity, Liouville CFT, quantization of Liouville theory, and also its duality to matrix quantum mechanics. You can find my update here: [Liouville.pdf](jmzhengphys.github.io/assets/Liouville.pdf).
